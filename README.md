this is a simple permit checker made out of PHP that I made to make permit checking more easier.
i made this while I'm bored lol

## Setup

Change line 87's url.


You can do whatever you want in the code. If you want to do some experiments then go for it :))

## Usage
To use the Permit Checker, put the permit number in the field and submit. it will send a post request to the permit site you have entered and gets the content. then it will filter the uneccessary tags and show the name.
